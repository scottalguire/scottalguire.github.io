title: Next Gen Anesti
author: Scott Alguire
tags: Development, WordPress, HTML, JS, SCSS, PHP
long_description: Developed a custom responsive WordPress website for a consulting firm. Includes static content, blog, events master/detail view (custom post type UI/advanced custom fields).
excerpt: When Next Gen Anesti approached me the existing anesti.ca website was outdated. It had been built using the GoDaddy Website Builder and it was apparent that the original template had been continually edited until it was no longer responsive, and cluttered.

When Next Gen Anesti approached me the existing anesti.ca website was outdated. It had been built using the GoDaddy Website Builder and it was apparent that the original template had been continually edited until it was no longer responsive, and cluttered.

I decided to create a brand new website using WordPress.
