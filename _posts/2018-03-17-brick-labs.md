### Before
* Navigation was breaking on some screens
* No mobile responsivity
* Appointment scheduling was clumsy and ugly
* The look failed to capture the fun and colourful nature of the business
* It was impossible for internal staff to edit content

### After
* Built a brand new custom WordPress theme
* Fully mobile responsive and optimized
* Navigation was simplified and now works everywhere
* Built custom appointment scheduling page that connects to Acuity Scheduling API
* The look was improved and imagery utilized to convey the fun nature of the business
* Using Advanced Custom Fields UI and Custom Post Types plugins, the theme was made easily editable for staff directly through the WordPress interface
