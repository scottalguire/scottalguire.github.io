## Well Nation 1.0

In February 2015 I designed and developed a custom WordPress theme to match the organization branding, which at the time could best be described as "American". I refer to this time as Well Nation 1.0.

The project included:
- Paper wireframing, brainstorming and feature analysis with marketing colleagues
- Designing mockups (in Photoshop)
- Developing an HTML/CSS/Javascript/Bootstrap template
- Developing template into a custom WordPress theme
- Designing graphics and video content
- Developing branded landing pages and sales tools for a marketing automation platform
- Following an SVN version control process for ongoing enhancements

## Well Nation 2.0

### The rebrand
As the company evolved we were embracing growth internationally, and wanted our brand image to reflect that. This was the beginning of an effort to "rebrand" Well Nation as a whole, and I was responsible for leading the charge. 

The brand needed to be agile so that it could reflect certain aspects of a particular geography, but also retain a sense of uniformity that was universally recognizable.

### New website theme

In coordination with a marketing partner we created a new WordPress theme to reflect the changes put forward in my branding guide. To expedite the time to launch our marketing partner chose to start building the theme using the "Divi Builder" from Elegant Themes.
